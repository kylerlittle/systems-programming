# systems-programming

## Description
**Update:** Last year, somebody stole my code straight from my public Cpt_S 321 repo. This year, as a result, I won't be pushing my code to the remote until after the assignment deadlines.

**My Typical Warning:** This repository will contain the assignments for Cpt_S 360 (Systems Programming) at Washington State University. Plagiarism is wrong, so do not copy. It's only doing yourself harm because you won't be learning the material, and it's quite easy for interviewers to tell.
